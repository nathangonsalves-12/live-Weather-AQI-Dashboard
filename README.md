# Live Weather and AQI Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes **live weather conditions** along with **Air Quality Index (AQI)** insights. The report is built using API-based data extraction, Power Query transformations, and dynamic calculations using **DAX Measures**.

---

## Project Overview
The dashboard provides a clear summary of:
- Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, precipitation, UV index)
- AQI level and air quality category
- Pollutant concentration levels (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, CO)
- Pollutant values compared against safe limits
- Top polluted cities ranking based on PM2.5 values
- Weekly temperature trend and forecast summary
